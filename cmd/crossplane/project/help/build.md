The `project build` command builds a Crossplane Project into a set of xpkgs. It
builds each embedded function in the project and a Configuration package that
ties everything together. The output of the build is a special `.xpkg` file
containing all the built packages, placed in the project's output directory
(`_output/` by default). The `project push` command can consume packges from the
output file and push them to an OCI registry.

The `build `command constructs the repository for the built Configuration from
`spec.repository` in `crossplane-project.yaml`. Override it for a single build
with `--repository`.

> **Important:** The repository influences the function names used for embedded
> function references in compositions. You must specify the same repository when
> building and pushing a project.

The build reuses the dependency cache populated by `crossplane dependency add`
and `crossplane dependency update-cache`. Override the cache location with
`--cache-dir` or the `CROSSPLANE_XPKG_CACHE` environment variable.

## Examples

Build the project in the current directory:

```shell
crossplane project build
```

Build the project, overriding the repository:

```shell
crossplane project build --repository=xpkg.crossplane.io/my-org/my-project
```

Build the project into a custom output directory:

```shell
crossplane project build -o ./packages
```
